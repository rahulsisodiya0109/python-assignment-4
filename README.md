# Python Assignment 4 - Files, Exceptions, and Errors in Python

## Task 1: Read a File and Handle Errors
This script reads a file named `sample.txt` and prints its content. If the file does not exist, it handles the error gracefully.

### Usage:
1. Run `read_file.py`.
2. Ensure `sample.txt` exists in the same directory.

## Task 2: Write and Append Data to a File
This script:
- Takes user input and writes it to `output.txt`.
- Appends more user input to the same file.
- Reads and displays the final content.

### Usage:
1. Run `write_append_file.py`.
2. Enter the text when prompted.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-assignment-4.git
2. Navigate to the folder:
cd python-assignment-4
3. Run the scripts:
python read_file.py python write_append_file.py
